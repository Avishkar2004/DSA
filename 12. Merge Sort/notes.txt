**Merge Sort** is a comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by recursively dividing an array into two halves until each half contains a single element, then merging these halves back together in a sorted manner.

### Key Points:

- **Divide and Conquer**: Merge Sort splits the array into smaller subarrays, sorts each subarray, and then merges them back together.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst), making it efficient for large datasets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the need for temporary arrays for merging.
- **Stability**: It is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

Merge Sort is especially useful for sorting linked lists or large arrays where consistent O(n log n) performance is needed.
