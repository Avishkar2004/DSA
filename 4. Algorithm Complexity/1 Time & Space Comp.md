Algorithm ?

- a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task

1. Time complexity :-

- the time complexcity is mainly calculated by couting the number of steps to finish the execution.
- line of code ‚àù(inversely proportional ) time
- Amount of time taken by algo to run, as a function of input size.
-time comp directly depend on input

2. Space Complexity :-

- space complexity is amount of space required to solve a problem
- space complexity = Auxilliary space + input size
- amount of memory taken by algo to run, as a function of input size

Input space :- how much variable we are taking
