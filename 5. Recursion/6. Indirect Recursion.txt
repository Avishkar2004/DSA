Indirect Recursion: In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circular manner.

From the above diagram fun(A) is calling for fun(B), fun(B) is calling for fun(C) and fun(C) is calling for fun(A) and thus it makes a cycle.


function funA(n) 
{ 
    if (n > 0) { 
        document.write(n.toFixed(0) + "</br>"); 
  
        // Fun(A) is calling fun(B) 
        funB(n - 1); 
    } 
} 
  
function funB(n) 
{ 
    if (n > 1) { 
        document.write(n.toFixed(0) + "</br>"); 
  
        // Fun(B) is calling fun(A) 
        funA(n / 2); 
    } 
} 
  
// Driver code 
funA(20); 

Output
 20 19 9 8 4 3 1
