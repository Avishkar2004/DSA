[20,12,53,3] :- how Selection sort work
we have to compare
jo hamare choti value rahegi usko replace kr denge

we are going to use for loop


Notes :-

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 

The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. 

Lets consider the following array as an example: arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11}

First pass:

- For the first position in the sorted array, the whole array is traversed from index 0 to 4 sequentially. The first position where 64 is stored presently, after traversing whole array it is clear that 11 is the lowest value.
- Thus, replace 64 with 11. After one iteration 11, which happens to be the least value in the array, tends to appear in the first position of the sorted list.

Second Pass:

- For the second position, where 25 is present, again traverse the rest of the array in a sequential manner.
- After traversing, we found that 12 is the second lowest value in the array and it should appear at the second place in the array, thus swap these values.

Third Pass:

- Now, for third place, where 25 is present again traverse the rest of the array and find the third least value present in the array.
- While traversing, 22 came out to be the third least value and it should appear at the third place in the array, thus swap 22 with element present at third position.

Fourth pass:

- Similarly, for fourth position traverse the rest of the array and find the fourth least element in the array 
- As 25 is the 4th lowest value hence, it will place at the fourth position.

Fifth Pass:

At last the largest value present in the array automatically get placed at the last position in the array
The resulted array is the sorted array.

// Javascript program for implementation of selection sort 
function swap(arr,xp, yp) 
{ 
    var temp = arr[xp]; 
    arr[xp] = arr[yp]; 
    arr[yp] = temp; 
} 
  
function selectionSort(arr,  n) 
{ 
    var i, j, min_idx; 
  
    // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray 
    for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) 
    { 
        // Find the minimum element in unsorted array 
        min_idx = i; 
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) 
        if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) 
            min_idx = j; 
  
        // Swap the found minimum element with the first element 
        swap(arr,min_idx, i); 
    } 
} 
  
function printArray( arr,  size) 
{ 
    var i; 
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++) 
        document.write(arr[i] + " "); 
    document.write(" <br>"); 
} 
  
var arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]; 
    var n = 5; 
    selectionSort(arr, n); 
    document.write("Sorted array: <br>"); 
    printArray(arr, n); 
  


Output
Sorted array: 
11 12 22 25 64 

Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort
Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N2) as there are two nested loops:

One loop to select an element of Array one by one = O(N)
Another loop to compare that element with every other Array element = O(N)
Therefore overall complexity = O(N) * O(N) = O(N*N) = O(N2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables while swapping two values in Array. The selection sort never makes more than O(N) swaps and can be useful when memory writing is costly. 

Advantages of Selection Sort Algorithm
Simple and easy to understand.
Works well with small datasets.

Disadvantages of the Selection Sort Algorithm
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
Does not work well on large datasets.
Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.

Frequently Asked Questions on Selection Sort
Q1. Is Selection Sort Algorithm stable?

The default implementation of the Selection Sort Algorithm is not stable. However, it can be made stable. 

Q2. Is Selection Sort Algorithm in-place?

Yes, Selection Sort Algorithm is an in-place algorithm, as it does not require extra space.
