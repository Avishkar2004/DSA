Algorithm ?

- a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task

1. Time complexity :-

- the time complexity is mainly calculated by couting the number of steps to finish the execution.
- line of code ∝(inversely proportional ) time
- Amount of time taken by algo to run, as a function of input size.
-time comp directly depend on input

2. Space Complexity :-

- space complexity is amount of space required to solve a problem
- space complexity = Auxilliary space + input size
- amount of memory taken by algo to run, as a function of input size

Input space :- how much variable we are taking



Notes :-
Algorithm :- step to do anything

Eg:- Array :- 

let data = []
element = 10
define loop
match element
if element == match
search complete
if not match
no result find

complexity :-



Algorithm :- 
1. Time Complexity :-
- The time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finishthe execution
- line of instructions(line) * time complexity
- f(n) = Time Complexity
f(n) = N*N = N

Eg:-
 => computer(1992) => 6 lines of code execution

2. Space :-
-Space complexity is the amount of space required to  solve a problem
-Space complexity = Auxilliary space + Input Size
How we count Space :- Array 10 lakh value + 2 gb Space + player + sound system + video + graphic + vs code + compiler + memory
- Eg :- big program taking 1 mb so that is a space complexity 


3. Big O Notation :-
- Used to denote Algorithm complexity(both)
- this is universal standard
